### Setting Up EmailJS

2. Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an email template with variables like `{{from_name}}`, `{{from_email}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{message}}`, and `{{date}}`
4. Get your service ID, template ID, and public key
5. Add these values to your environment variables

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your portfolio is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the platform from the creators of Next.js.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import your project to Vercel.

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
4. Vercel will detect that you're using Next.js and set up the build configuration for you.
